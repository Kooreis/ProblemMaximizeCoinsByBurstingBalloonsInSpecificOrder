# Question: How do you maximize the number of coins by bursting balloons in a specific order? C# Summary

The C# program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the number of coins obtained by bursting balloons in a specific order. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to achieve this. The `MaxCoins` function is the core of the solution. It first creates a new array that includes the original balloon values, but with 1's added at the beginning and end. It then creates a two-dimensional array to store the maximum number of coins that can be obtained for different ranges of balloons. The function iterates over the array, calculating the maximum coins that can be obtained by bursting each balloon in the range, considering the coins obtained from bursting the balloons to the left and right of it. The maximum coins obtained are stored in the two-dimensional array. The function finally returns the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by bursting all the balloons, which is stored in the top right corner of the two-dimensional array. The `Main` function initializes the balloon array and calls the `MaxCoins` function to get the result.

# Python Differences

The Python and C# versions of the solution are very similar in their approach to solving the problem. Both use dynamic programming and a 2D array (or list in Python) to store the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by bursting balloons in a specific order. The main difference lies in the syntax and language-specific features used in each solution.

In the C# version, the `MaxCoins` function uses a foreach loop to populate the `array` with the balloon numbers, excluding any that are 0. It then uses nested for loops to calculate the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by bursting the balloons in a specific order. The `Math.Max` function is used to find the maximum value.

In the Python version, the `maxCoins` function uses list concatenation to add 1 to the beginning and end of the list of balloon numbers. It then uses list comprehension to initialize a 2D list `dp` with zeros. It uses nested for loops to calculate the maximum number of coins, similar to the C# version. However, the Python version iterates over the list in reverse order, which is a feature not used in the C# version. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value.

The Python version also includes a `main` function that takes user input and prints the result, whereas the C# version hardcodes the input and writes the result to the console. The Python version uses the `map` function to convert the user input to a list of integers, and the `split` function to separate the input string into individual numbers. The C# version does not have these features because it does not take user input.

In terms of language-specific features, the C# version uses a 2D array and the `Math.Max` function, whereas the Python version uses list concatenation, list comprehension, the `max` function, and the `map` and `split` functions for user input.

# Java Differences

Both the C# and Java versions solve the problem using a similar dynamic programming approach. They both create a 2D array to store the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by bursting balloons in a specific order. They then iterate over the array, calculating the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by bursting each balloon last and updating the array accordingly.

However, there are a few differences between the two versions:

1. Input: The C# version has a hardcoded array of balloon values, while the Java version prompts the user to input the number of balloons and the coins in each balloon.

2. Array Initialization: In the C# version, the array is initialized with a size of `nums.Length + 2` and the first and last elements are set to 1. In the Java version, the array is initialized with a size of `n + 2` (where `n` is the user input) and the first and last elements are also set to 1.

3. Array Indexing: C# uses comma-separated indices (e.g., `dp[left, right]`) to access elements in a 2D array, while Java uses bracketed indices (e.g., `dp[left][right]`).

4. Loop Variables: The C# version uses `k` as the loop variable to iterate over the length of the subarray, while the Java version uses `len`.

5. Output: The C# version returns the maximum number of coins as an integer, while the Java version prints the maximum number of coins to the console.
